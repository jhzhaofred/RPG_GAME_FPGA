The object of RPG Escape is for the first player to win the game by defeating enemies and a boss in turn-based battles. This game requires a second person to play in order for the enemies to attack.  The story of the game is that the player's character has been kidnapped and now needs to escape the maze of his enemies.  Everytime the player collides with an enemy, a battle starts.  When the battle starts, the player's HP is reset to 100 or 150 if the player has defeated five enemies, while the enemy's HP is set to any number between 50 and 100.  The boss, however, has 150 HP.  Once the boss is defeated, the player wins the game.
